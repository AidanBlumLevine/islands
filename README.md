# islands

Procedurally generated noise based islands, inspired by the art in [Godus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godus).

The generator combines noise to create a height map, then uses [marching squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) to create layers, which are then extruded to make 3D meshes. These are rendered in [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
